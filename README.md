## How it works

Music With STYLE excecutes CSS styling properties on targetted elements and they will respond to the audio frequencies of a song. 

Simply place the provided special class names to targetted elements and watch them have a party.

`party-time-{property}`

### Example

The following will apply a text glow and will change the glow color when the audio frequency changes.

`<p class="party-time-textShadow">Visual Text</p>`

## Auto Party
